            <p>Regular physical activity can improve your muscle strength and boost your endurance. 
                Exercise delivers oxygen and nutrients to your tissues and helps your cardiovascular 
                system work more efficiently. And when your heart and lung health improve, you have 
                more energy to tackle daily chores.

                <h2>Why Should I Join A Gym ?</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><span>MEET WORKOUT BUDDIES</span>
                        <p>When you’re dedicated to living a healthy lifestyle, it can be tough to find 
                        like-minded people who will support you, let alone someone you can work out 
                        with. But at a gym, everyone is there to get fit and improve their health. Having 
                        someone to meet for a fitness class or go out for coffee with afterward is a great 
                        motivator, and makes every workout more fun.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><span>PROLONG YOUR LIFE</span>
                        <p>Studies have shown that exercise can lower your risk for certain types of diseases 
                            and even help you live longer. With all the classes and equipment available at 
                            your local Genesis gym, you’re sure to find exercises you love.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><span>BOOST YOUR ENERGY AND MOOD</span>
                        <p>There’s no feeling like post-workout bliss! The endorphins your body produces 
                            during exercise create a positive feeling in your brain, and the sense of 
                            accomplishment you get from finishing a workout is a great confidence-booster. For 
                            people suffering from depression, regular exercise is proven to be an effective 
                            treatment. Joining a gym could help you get back into your groove, meet people, 
                            and feel good about yourself!</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><span>IMPROVE YOUR HEALTH</span>
                        <p>Joining a gym can help you stay motivated to exercise consistently. This is a great 
                            way to build muscle, lose weight, lower blood pressure, boost mental focus, and more. 
                            Over time, you can look better, feel better, and accomplish things you never thought possible!</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><span>DE-STRESS AND RELAX</span>
                        <p>Feeling pretty stressed after work? Stop by the gym on your way home. Even a short workout 
                            will make you feel better than that bag of potato chips waiting for you in your pantry. For 
                            even more relaxation, gym memberships include yoga classes for beginner through 
                            advanced levels.</p>
