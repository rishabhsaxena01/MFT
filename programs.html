                            things that don’t require high tech equipment. If you incorporate floor routines into your routine, 
                            building up significant muscles in your body such as core strength, muscular endurance, and

                            Weight training is also known as resistance or strength training, for developing the strength and 
                            size of skeletal muscles. It involves moving parts of your body against some kind of resistance, 
                            like weights. Weight training provides a stress to the muscles that causes them to adapt and get 
                            stronger, similar to the way aerobic conditioning strengthens your heart. Weight training usually 
                            requires different types of equipment, but most commonly dumbbells, barbells, and weight machines. 
                            Various combinations of specific exercises, weights, and machines allow trainees to exercise the 
                            body in numerous ways.

                            When it comes to cardiovascular exercises, the options are endless to improve your overall quality 
                            of life. When part of an overall heart-healthy lifestyle, not only can regular cardio exercise 
                            lead to an increase in your resting blood pressure and heart rate, but these basic changes can 
                            also mean your heart doesn’t have to work unnecessarily hard all of the time. With aerobic or 
                            cardio exercise, your muscles need more blood and oxygen than when they’re at rest. This causes 
                            your heart and lungs to work harder, which, over time, can make these parts of your body stronger. 
                            And, as your heart and lungs become stronger, the flow of blood and oxygen in your body will also 
                            improve. Cardio or aerobic exercise encompasses many types of activities. Some activities like 
                            walking can be done at a moderate pace. Other activities, like running, biking uphill, jumping rope, 
                            or swimming laps can be done at a more intense pace.

                        <p class="program-detail">
                            Yoga is a group of physical, mental, and spiritual practices or disciplines which originated in ancient 
                            India and aim to control and still the mind, recognizing a detached witness-consciousness untouched by 
                            the mind (Chitta) and mundane suffering (Duḥkha). The purpose of yoga is to build strength, awareness 
                            and harmony in both the mind and body. Because there are so many different kinds of yoga practices, it 
                            is possible for anyone to start. Whether you’re a couch potato or a professional athlete, size and fitness 
                            levels do not matter because there are modifications for every yoga pose and beginner classes in every 
                            style. The idea is to explore your limits, not strive for some pretzel-like perfection. It is a great way 
                            to get in tune with your body and your inner self.”​ The relaxation techniques incorporated in yoga can 
                            lessen chronic pain, such as lower back pain, arthritis, headaches and carpal tunnel syndrome. Yoga can 
                            also lower blood pressure and reduce insomnia. Aside from the physical benefits, one of the best benefits 
                            of yoga is how it helps a person manage stress, which is known to have devastating effects on the body 
                            and mind. Yoga can be very effective in developing coping skills and reaching a more positive outlook on life.

                        <p class="program-detail">
                            Zumba is a fitness program that involves cardio and Latin-inspired dance. It's fun, the more you enjoy your 
                            exercise routine, the more likely you are to stick with it. Zumba is intended as a total-body cardio and 
                            aerobic workout, which provides a large calorie consumption. Since music played during a Zumba class is 
                            relatively fast-paced, moving to the beat can help build your endurance after just a few workouts. One study 
                            found that after 12 weeks of a Zumba program, participants showed a decreased heart rate and systolic blood 
                            pressure with an increase of work. You may be able to burn between 300 and 900 calories during one hour of 
                            mid- to high-intensity Zumba. Doing Zumba two or three times a week, combined with weekly strength training 
                            sessions and a balanced diet, may help you meet your weight loss goals.
